### Lessons Learned
I compared to the previous week, I said ask for help early and often, adding on to that, with each week I find that 
I am able to put my pride to the side and ask for help 
after a few tries instead of waiting hours. Also I as much as I want to make things fun, it can also cause confusion,
especially with making variables. Don't be afraid to start over and do exactly what the assignment says.
